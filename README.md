# Awslive::Poster
[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/awslive-poster.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/awslive-poster)

Welcome to your awslive-poster gem!. 
Currently there is no easy and cost effective way to get the poster image URL for a AWS medialive channel.
This utility auto computes the poster URL for a AWS media channel and creates a presigned URL to access poster image.

## High-Level System View

![alt text](https://github.com/cloudaffair/awslive-poster/blob/master/misc/highlevel-view.png)

* `1` Cloudwatch Events pushed for Channel State change.
* `2` Cloudwatch Rule for channel state change triggers Channel monitor Lambda
* `3` Lambda identifies the channel Id and its start Time.
* `4` Records the Start time of the channel in a Media channel Tag with name `channel_start_time`

* `Z` Media Channel is configured for a framecapture output group that pushes the captured images onto configured S3 bucket

* `A` `aws-poster` gem when invoked for `get_url`, inspects the channel and identifies the channel start time using the tag `channel_start_time` provisioned.
* `B` Once the start time is identified, `aws-poster` gem computes the sequential counter and constructs the current preview presigned URL.
* `C` Returns the presigned URL constructed.

## Deploy the channel Monitor Lambda using Terraform.
